In the 1960s, Takata started to sell seat-belts and built Japan's first crash test plant for testing seat-belts under real world conditions. In the 1970s, Takata developed child restraint systems. In the 1980s, the company changed its name to \"Takata Corporation\" and expanded",

Unbelted occupants sustained fatal injuries throughout the whole speed scale, whereas none of the belted occupants was fatally injured at accident speeds below 60 mph. No belted occupant was fatally injured if the passenger compartment remained intact. This study resulted in the U.S. Department of Transportation requiring three-point seat belts in American cars.
